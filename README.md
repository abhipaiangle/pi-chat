# Pi-Chat (Real-Time Chat Application)

This project is an online messaging service, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into the site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.

This application is built using **Flask** and **Socket-IO**. This is a live chat app and won't store your details for a long time.
