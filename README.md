# Flack 

### Objectives

* Learn to use JavaScript to run code server-side.
* Become more comfortable with building web user interfaces.
* Gain experience with Socket.IO to communicate between clients and servers.

### Overview

In this project, youâ€™ll build an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.
